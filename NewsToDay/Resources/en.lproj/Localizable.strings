This document is not required by the current legislation, but it helps users (1) understand the permissible ways they use the application on a smartphone or other device; (2) determine the possible consequences of using the application in one way or another; (3) identify the liability measures applied to users for violating the established rules.

The agreement is nothing more than the rules of the game for the user, because of this, it is difficult to overestimate the value of this document. As soon as the user agrees to the terms of the Agreement (for example, by ticking a box in the allotted field or by installing the program on a smartphone), the terms of this Agreement are legally binding for the user. Thus, the violation by the user of the terms of the Agreement inevitably entails the application to such a user of the types of liability provided for in such an Agreement.

The proposed document template is suitable for applications of any kind, for example, an online store, a game, a social network, access to a cloud platform, business, media (magazines), etc. Please note that this document cannot be used for websites (you can use the User Agreement for the website) or cloud platforms (you can use the User Agreement for the cloud platform).

The User Agreement should not be identified with the Privacy Policy (a document defining the procedure for collecting and processing personal data of users) for several reasons. Firstly, the privacy policy is a mandatory document, and secondly, such a document exclusively focuses on the methods, methods, timing and purposes of processing and collecting personal data.

Please note that some provisions of this document are set out in capital letters. This is done in order to draw the user's attention to important points concerning, for example, the limitation of the responsibility of application developers for this or that harm caused to the user for using the application and its content.
